# Langflow Integration

**Langflow** ([GitHub](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow)): Langflow is a UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.

## Integration

With the native integration, you can use Langflow to quickly create complex LLM applications in no-code and then use Langfuse to monitor and improve them. To trace all executions from Langflow in Langfuse, you just need to export your Langfuse api keys as environment variables:

```sh
# API keys from project settings in Langfuse
export LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
export LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your public key>
```

Alternatively, you can run the Langflow CLI command:

```sh
LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key> LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your public key> langflow
```

## Custom host

If you self-host Langfuse, you can set the additional environment variable `LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_HOST` to point to your Langfuse instance.
